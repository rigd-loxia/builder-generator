# Software Component: Builder generator

This builder came forth from a need for a builder which would work the same as the one generated by a jaxb-module.

## Yet another builder generator, but different
Below is a table with different builders and what support they have in comparison to this builder generator:

| Builder            | Fluent Prefix 'with' | Nested Builders    | Builder inheritence | Remarks |
| :----------------- | :------------------: | :----------------: | :-----------------: | :------ |
| lombok Builder     | :heavy_check_mark:   |                    |                     | With the way lombok works implementing nested builders will not be supported |
| lombok SuperBuilder| :heavy_check_mark:   |                    | :heavy_check_mark:  | With the way lombok works implementing nested builders will not be supported |
| Jilt               |                      |                    |                     | Does not follow javabean spec |
| Pojobuilder        | :heavy_check_mark:   |                    |                     |         |
| Freebuilder        |                      | :heavy_check_mark: |                     | Requires interfaces instead of classes as the source for the builder. |
| Immutables         |                      |                    | :heavy_check_mark:  | Requires interfaces instead of classes as the source for the builder. |
| RIGD-Loxia builder | :heavy_check_mark:   | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:  |         |

Need a support for other styles, feel free to make an issue for this. If you want you can even make a PR for it.

## Description
Generates `Builder` classes based on the `@Builder` annotation.
The following are by default generated
* fluent api met `with` prefix.
* builder chaining
* builder inheritence
* builder copyOf method

There are currently no support for options, although with PR's being merged this will change.

### SeeAlso annotation
If a class or interface is annotated with `@SeeAlso(class, class, ...)` then any non-abstract class mentioned here will be available for chaining from the builder.
It does not matter where the SeeAlso annotation is defined, only the annotation name is checked.

example for the annotation:
```java
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target(TYPE)
public @interface SeeAlso {
    Class<?>[] value() default {};
}
```

### CopyOf method configuration
It is possible to configure whether or not a copyOf method is generated through the use of compiler arguments or `@Builder` annotation property.
If the `@Builder` annotation property is defined then this value is used, otherwise the compiler argument is used.
If neither are present then the copyOf method will be generated.

example for disabling the copyOf method:
```java
@Builder(copyOf = BOOLEAN.FALSE)
```
or through compiler arguments:
```
	<compilerArgs>
		<!-- testCompiling is used to skip the generation of builder classes for which the processor should generate a compilation error. -->
		<arg>-nl.loxia.BuilderGenerator.copyOfMethodGeneration=false</arg>
	</compilerArgs>
```

## Usage example
Take for example the following structure of classes:
```java
class Car {
    private String brand;
	private int numberOfDoors;
	private Engine engine;
	private List<Seat> seats;
}

class Engine {
	private String name;
	private int topSpeed;
}

class Seat {
	private String type;
}
```

If we would annotate all classes with the `@Builder` annotation we could use the following bit of code to create the Car class:

```java
private Car createCar() {
	return new CarBuilder()
		.withBrand("Custom Made")
		.withNumberOfDoors(4)
		.withEngine()
			.withName("V7 refurbished")
			.withTopSpeed(250)
		.end()
		.addSeats()
			withType("driver seat")
		.end()
		.addSeats()
			withType("front passenger seat")
		.end()
		.addSeats()
			withType("large back seat")
		.end()
		.build();
}
```

## Installation using maven
### Adding the dependency on the annotations
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>nl.loxia.builder.generator</groupId>
    <artifactId>annotations</artifactId>
    <version>${buildergenerator.version}</version>
</dependency>
```
### Configuring APT for generating classes
```
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <configuration>
                    <annotationProcessorPaths>
                        <annotationProcessorPath>
                            <groupId>nl.loxia.builder.generator</groupId>
                            <artifactId>builderGenerator</artifactId>
                            <version>${buildergenerator.version}</version>
                        </annotationProcessorPath>
                    </annotationProcessorPaths>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
```

## Release Notes
### 0.2.0 (upcoming release)
* copyOf method can now be disabled, this allows for generation of builders without matching get methods for each field.

### 0.1.0
* Fixed SeeAlso ordering, first childs then parents instead of first parents then childs.
* copyOf method now supports the SeeAlso referencing.
* copyOf method now does an in-depth copy.
* Builder-collections for builder-chaining combined with collections will now be correctly instantiated.
* Builders for builder-chaining with direct field will only be instantiated once. Sequential actions take place on the same builder.
* Lists now have a `add...` method which accepts a varArgs instead of a single value.
* Compiler warning when parent is missing `@Builder` annotation.
* Added 'copyOf' method to all builders
